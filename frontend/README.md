# Bicycletron

A SPA about showing bikes and their brands, with a React frontend and a Django backend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

To run the frontend just use `yarn` to install the dependencies and then `yarn start` (see below).\
To avoid having to ramp up the django backend you can set the `USE_MOCKS` flag in the `src/config.ts` file to `true`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
